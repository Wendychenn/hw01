##  Wendy's homework 01 
---
  Hi guys, I'm Wendy Chen, a first year PhD student from PME. I'm looking forward to utilizing R to statically analyze and summarize data obtained from my lab. 
  
  I don't install my Git at the default location at first so I fail to connect a local RStudio project to a GitHub repo. I uninstall the Git after that, and install it correctly. But it shows *fatal: remote origin already exists*, when I mistype the url command at the beginning.
  
  What I find is that "origin" is the default name Git gives to the server I'm using. Because I'm cloning my repository, I need to link *origin* to my url correctly.
  
  [The website to know git remote](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes)
  
  
   I open a new project, submit the right url and get the cloning done successfully.
  ![image of success](https://fiverr-res.cloudinary.com/images/q_auto,f_auto/gigs/128537975/original/5958e62b86a1661db95e8769b149b71161e4a7b2/send-you-encouraging-message-everyday.jpg)
  
  Through this, I have at least 3 findings:
  * GitHub is complex for a beginner, I need to know more about the commands
  * GitHub is a great resource to solve problems 
  * Just knowing what to do to solve the problems is not enough for the computational programming, I need to know why and how.
  
  After finishing cloning to my RStudio local file, further steps are easy to follow. All I need to do are writing README.md in Markdown, pushing it to the server and commiting the changes.
